# What is Stat to Stat?

Stat to Stat is a mobile and web friendly app that is designed to allow users to compare stats from different players/teams in one location.

## Why make Stat to Stat?

Co-Developer and Founder Jeremy Cook has been an avid sports fan his entire life, but always ran into the issue of having to use multiple tabs and/or monitors to compare stats. After completing a coding boot camp with fellow Co-Developer and Founder Shawn Gay, Jeremy reached out to see if they could make it happen, and Stat to Stat was born.
